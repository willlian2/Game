A simple test based game. Currently you can move through rooms and do combat
with a single goblin(who appears randomly as you move through rooms).
Combat currently allows for a character(of which there are two, a fighter
and a wizard) to use a basic attack, and for the wizard to cast spells.
In addition you can force the goblin to spawn by typing test when asked
what would you like to do. The next goal is to add more encounter types,
enimes and a leveling system. Known bugs are that the wizard can cast infinitly
without expending spell slots, as well as a few issues with the fail 
cases on a wizard casting.
